<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
  This page houses information about some of my ongoing, fanciful, possibly insane, perhaps somewhat expensive, totally not complete, and already late projects that I'm working on.
</p>

<ul>
{% for project in site.projects %}
  <li><a href="/p/{{ project.slug }}">{{ project.title }}</a> - {{ project.summary }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
