  <h2>Me...</h2>
  <p>
    I am a web developer, system administrator, tinkerer, a dabbler in graphic design, and a native New Jerseyan.  I don't see myself as having any one particular field of interest, but rather just try to go wherever life takes me.  Often times I will find myself entrenched in all kinds of projects; ranging from hardware development (which I'm not exceedingly good at yet), to building software that fits a particular need, to designing a new Deco-style poster to fill an empty space on my wall.  I am passionate about development and engineering in all its forms, and hold a great deal of respect and admiration for those who have laid the foundations for my work.

  <h2>The Site...</h2>
  <p>
    This site is here as a general rally point for my many unfinished ideas, partial plans, sordid rants, and should the mood strike me just right -- project documentation.  I will try to keep it updated with my current goings-on and progress as projects move forward, sideways, or fold in on themselves.  The design was generally inspired by the work of Massimo Vignelli; specifically his Stendig Calendar and 1972 New York City Subway Map, two unbelievable designs that I absolutely adore.
