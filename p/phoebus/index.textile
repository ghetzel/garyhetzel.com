h2. Overview

Phoebus is a project that encompasses multiple components that provide multimedia streaming and presentation capabilities to a highly extensible range of media formats.  The purpose of the project is to allow universal access to personal media libraries by way of a web application; but also includes the backend file indexing, metadata collection and management, and dynamic media transcoding via a series of independent but compatible service applications and web service layers.
