h2. Overview

Catalina is a hardware and software project designed to outfit my car with an onboard computer for interactive use.  The primary goals of this project are:

* Replace and augment the functionality of the existing radio/CD player, including audio and video playback from local disk, external mass storage, or over the Internet.

* Collect and store on-board data from vehicle sensors and OBD-II engine telemetry for display and analysis.

* Integrate a navigation into the car with intelligent, spatially-aware events.
